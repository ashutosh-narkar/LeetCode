The Assignment Problem: Suppose we have 'n' resources to which we want to assign to
'n' tasks on a one-to-one basis. Suppose also that we know the cost of
assigning a given resource to a given task. We wish to find an optimal assignment - one which minimizes total cost.

Solution: The Hungarian Method
Runtime: O(n ^ 3)
